# Forecasting-of-electric-consumption

This repository hosts [the analysis](https://github.com/asonnellini/Forecasting-of-electric-consumption/blob/main/Andrea_Sonnellini.pdf) I performed to forecast the energy consumption of a building for the next day, based on previous measurements.

This analysis was done as part of the assignment of the class Time Series Analysis at DSTI, cohort S20.
