# Forecast the electric consumption of a building

This repository hosts [the analysis](https://github.com/asonnellini/Forecasting-of-electric-consumption/blob/main/Andrea_Sonnellini.pdf) I performed to forecast the energy consumption of a building for the next day, based on measurements of temperature and energy consumption of the previous weeks.

This analysis was done as part of the assignment of the class Time Series Analysis at DSTI, cohort S20.
